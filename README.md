# Fylo Data Storage Component

![](/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

The objcetive in this challenge was to build out a data storage component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. But I did some extras ideas to test myself, I added loading animations with the data storage bar, and created a Node.js server, and send data to a server using XMLHttpRequest.
